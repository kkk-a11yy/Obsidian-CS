description: "Praise for the First Edition &quot;This is a well-written and impressively presented introduction to probability and statistics. The text throughout is highly readable, and the author makes liberal use of graphs and diagrams to clarify the theory.&quot; - The Statistician Thoroughly updated, Probability: An Introduction with Statistical Applications, Second Edition features a comprehensive exploration of statistical data analysis as an application of probability. The new edition provides an introduction to statistics with accessible coverage of reliability, acceptance sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and simple linear regression. Encouraging readers to develop a deeper intuitive understanding of probability, the author presents illustrative geometrical presentations and arguments without the need for rigorous mathematical proofs. The Second Edition features interesting and practical examples from a variety of engineering and scientific fields, as well as: Over 880 problems at varying degrees of difficulty allowing readers to take on more challenging problems as their skill levels increase Chapter-by-chapter projects that aid in the visualization of probability distributions New coverage of statistical quality control and quality production An appendix dedicated to the use of MathematicaÂ® and a companion website containing the referenced data sets Featuring a practical and real-world approach, this textbook is ideal for a first course in probability for students majoring in statistics, engineering, business, psychology, operations research, and mathematics. Probability: An Introduction with Statistical Applications, Second Edition is also an excellent reference for researchers and professionals in any discipline who need to make decisions based on data as well as readers interested in learning how to accomplish effective decision making from data."
