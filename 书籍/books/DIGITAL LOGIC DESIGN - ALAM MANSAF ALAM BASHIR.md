description: This textbook covers latest topics in the field of digital logic design along with tools to design the digital logic circuits. It is designed for the undergraduate students pursuing courses in areas of engineering disciplines such as Electrical and Electronics, Electronics and Communication, Electronics and Instrumentation, Telecommunications, and Computer Science and Engineering. It is also useful as a text for MCA, M.Sc. (Electronics) and M.Sc. (Computer Science) students. The contents of this book have been organized in a systematic manner so as to inculcate sound knowledge and concepts amongst its readers. It covers basic concepts in combinational and sequential circuit design such as digital electronics, digital signal processing, number system, data and information representation and, computer arithmetic. Besides this, advanced topics in digital logic design such as various types of counter design, register design, ALU design, threshold circuit and, digital computer design are also discussed in the book. Key features • Question Bank containing numerous multiple choice questions with their answers • Short answer questions, long answer questions and multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter • Extensive use of graphs and diagrams for better understanding of the subject
