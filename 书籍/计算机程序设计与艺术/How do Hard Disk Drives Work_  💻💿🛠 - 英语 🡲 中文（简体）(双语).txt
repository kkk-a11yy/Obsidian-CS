Imagine every picture you took over the past year, all saved within the area of a single dot of ink
想象一下你在过去一年拍摄的每张照片，都保存在圆珠笔的一个墨水点的区域内

from a ballpoint pen. Well, this is approximately how compact data is stored inside a hard disk

驱动器中的大致存储方式，在本视频中，我们将打开一个硬盘，看看整个图书馆的藏书如何

able to fit within the surface of this metal disk. We’ll start by opening up this hard drive and
能够容纳在这个金属盘的表面。我们首先打开这个硬盘驱动器并详细

detailing the components inside. After that, we’ll dive into exactly how the drive stores data using
介绍其中的组件。 之后，我们将深入研究驱动器如何使用

the read and write head, and in the process, we’ll look at the tracks, sectors, and magnetic domains
读写头存储数据，在此过程中，我们将查看金属磁盘的磁道、扇区和磁域

of the metal disk. Finally, we’ll explore some of the latest advances that enable over a terabit of
。 最后，我们将探讨一些最新的进展，这些进展使超过 1 TB 的

data to fit within every square inch of the disk. This video is sponsored by PCBWay; more
数据能够容纳在磁盘的每一平方英寸内。 本视频由 PCBWay 赞助；

on them later, but for now let’s jump right in. On the inside of this drive, we find a variety of
稍后会详细介绍它们，但现在让我们直接进入。在这个驱动器的内部，我们发现了各种

components. Here’s the disk or platter that stores all the data, and, depending on the
组件。 这是存储所有数据的磁盘或盘片，根据

storage capacity of the drive, might be multiple platters tall. The disk is composed of an aluminum
驱动器的存储容量，可能有多个盘片那么高。 圆盘由

magnesium alloy with multiple coatings of other alloys, but the magnetic, functional layer is
铝镁合金和其他合金的多层涂层组成，但磁性功能层是

this 120-nanometer thin layer of a cobalt chromium tantalum alloy which has small magnetic domains or
这个 120 纳米的钴铬钽合金薄层，它具有小磁畴或

regions whose direction can be manipulated via external magnetic fields. The platter is mounted
方向可以通过外部磁性控制的区域 领域。 转盘安装

on a spindle which spins at a speed of 7200 rpm using a brushless DC motor at its center.
在主轴上，主轴使用位于其中心的无刷直流电机以 7200 rpm 的速度旋转。

Next, there’s a head stack assembly, with one arm above and one arm below each disc,
接下来，有一个磁头组组件，每个磁盘上方有一个臂，每个磁盘下方有一个臂，每个臂的

and with a slider and a read/write head at the end of each arm. The slider is uniquely designed
末端都有一个滑块和一个读/写头。 滑块设计独特，

such that it catches the airflow generated by the ludicrously fast-spinning disk and uses the
它可以捕捉由旋转得快得离谱的磁盘产生的气流，并利用

air flow to float or fly the read/write head so that it’s only 15 nanometers or about 100 atoms
气流漂浮或飞行读/写头，使其距离磁盘表面仅 15 纳米或约 100 个原子

away from the surface of the disk. For reference, here’s the thickness of a sheet of aluminum foil.
. 作为参考，这是一张铝箔纸的厚度。

Because the arm assembly flies on top of the spinning disk, it’s only brought over
因为臂组件在旋转的圆盘顶部飞行，所以它只有

the surface when it’s at full speed, and when the disk is not spinning, the arm assembly is
在全速时才会带过表面，而当圆盘不旋转时，臂组件会

parked to the side on a small piece of plastic. Back here a voice coil motor composed of a coil
停在一小块塑料的侧面。回到这里，一个音圈电机由一个

of wire and two strong neodymium magnets above and below is used to move the entire arm stack
线圈和上下两个强大的钕磁铁组成，用于移动整个臂叠

assembly. When electric current is run through the coil it creates an electromagnet which
组件。 当电流流过线圈时，它会产生一个受

is influenced by the neodymium magnets, thus generating a force that causes the arm to move
钕磁铁影响的电磁铁，从而产生一个力，使手臂

across the disk. When a reverse current is sent through the voice coil, the arm is forced in the
在圆盘上移动。 当通过音圈发送反向电流时，臂被迫沿

opposite direction, thereby enabling control of the exact position of the read/write head within
相反方向移动，从而能够将读/写头的精确位置控制在

30 or so nanometers. Additionally, the magnets and voice coil make a rather strong motor that enable
30 纳米左右的范围内。 此外，磁铁和音圈构成了一个相当强大的电机，使

the lightweight arm stack assembly and read/write head to move back and forth to different tracks
轻型臂堆叠组件和读/写头能够

across the platter up to 20 times a second and to make small adjustments incredibly fast.
以每秒 20 次的速度在盘片上的不同轨道上来回移动，并以令人难以置信的速度进行小幅调整。

In order to connect to the read/write head, a flexible ribbon of wires is routed along the
为了连接到读/写头，一条柔性电线带沿着

side of the arm and down to this connector which feeds signals to the outside of the hard drive
臂的一侧布线并向下连接到该连接器，该连接器将信号馈送到硬盘驱动器外壳的外部

和印刷电路板或 PCB。在 PCB 上，我们有主处理器和

a DRAM chip, which is used as a scratchpad for the processor and a buffer for the incoming and
DRAM 芯片，用作处理器的暂存器和传入和

outgoing data. Additionally mounted on the PCB is a chip for controlling the voice coil and
传出数据的缓冲区。  PCB 上还安装了一个用于控制音圈和

brushless DC spindle motor, and then on the edge of the PCB is a SATA connector which connects to
无刷直流主轴电机的芯片，然后在PCB 的边缘是一个 SATA 连接器，它连接到

the motherboard for communications and a separate connector which goes to the power supply.
主板进行通信，还有一个单独的连接器连接到电源。

Additional important components are the gasket that seals the disk from the exterior environment
其他重要组件是将磁盘与外部环境密封的垫圈，

and two filters that catch any stray dust particles. These filters are necessary since
以及两个用于捕获任何杂散灰尘颗粒的过滤器。 这些过滤器是必需的，因为

the read/write heads are just 15 nanometers away from the platter, and a single dust particle
读/写磁头距离盘片仅 15 纳米，单个灰尘颗粒

can be up to 10,000 nanometers large and could cause major damage if it were to collide with
最大可达 10,000 纳米，如果它与 7,200 rpm 的磁盘碰撞可能会造成重大损坏

the 7,200-rpm disk. Now that we’ve looked through many of these components, let’s see how they work.
。 现在我们已经了解了其中的许多组件，让我们看看它们是如何工作的。

To begin, the disk is divided into concentric circles of tracks. The latest hard drives can
首先，磁盘被分成同心圆轨道。 最新的硬盘驱动器

have more than 500,000 tracks on just one side. These tracks are then divided into sectors, and
单面可以有超过 500,000 个磁道。然后将这些磁道分成多个扇区，

in each sector is a preamble or synchronization zone which tells the read/write head the exact
每个扇区中都有一个前导码或同步区，它告诉读/写磁头

speed of the spinning disk and the length of each bit of data. The next part of the sector is the
旋转磁盘的确切速度和每一位数据的长度。 扇区的下一部分是

address which helps the read/write head know which track and sector it’s currently positioned over.
地址，它帮助读/写头知道它当前位于哪个磁道和扇区。

After that we have the actual data that’s stored, typically 4 kilobytes of data per sector. Next is
之后我们就有了实际存储的数据，通常是每个扇区 4 KB 的数据。 接下来是

an area for an error correcting code, or ECC, which is used to verify that the data stored in
纠错码或 ECC 的区域，用于验证存储在块中的数据是否

the block is accurately written and properly read, and finally there’s a gap between this sector and
被准确写入和正确读取，最后在这个扇区和

the next which allows the read/write head some tolerance when writing the contents of a block.
下一个允许读/写磁头的扇区之间有一个间隙写入块内容时的一些容差。

Now let’s zoom in on the read/write head and the disk to see exactly how data is
现在让我们放大读/写磁头和磁盘，以准确了解数据是如何

written and read. Writing data to the disk is done by manipulating the direction of
写入和读取的。 将数据写入磁盘是通过操纵磁盘

magnetization of a localized region or domain of the cobalt-chromium-tantalum layer in the
中钴-铬-钽层的局部区域或域的磁化方向

disk and forcing the region to be magnetized in the up direction or the down direction.
并强制该区域在向上或向下方向磁化来完成的。

This tiny magnetic domain or region is around 90 by 100 by 125 nanometers, and when magnetized,
这个微小的磁畴或区域大约为 90x 100 x 125 纳米，当被磁化时，

all the atoms will have their even tinier magnetic north/south poles pointing in the same direction.
所有原子的更小磁北极/南极都将指向同一方向。

In order to magnetize a single domain, which is equivalent to writing a single bit of data,
为了磁化单个磁畴，相当于写入一位数据，将

a current is applied to a coil of wire at the back of the write head, thus creating a
电流施加到写入磁头背面的线圈，从而在

strong magnetic field back here. The magnetic field is channeled through the write head and
此处产生强磁场。磁场通过写入磁头引导并

focused into a small point at the tip and then jumps across the 15-nanometer air gap and into
聚焦到尖端的一个小点，然后跳过 15 纳米的气隙并进入

the disk. When the focused magnetic field passes into a single domain of cobalt-chromium-tantalum,
磁盘。 当聚焦磁场进入钴-铬-钽的单一域时，

all these atoms are forced to align their tiny atomic magnetic fields
所有这些原子被迫将它们的微小原子磁场

with the applied magnetic field from the write head, thus turning the small domain
与写入头施加的磁场对齐，从而将小域

or region into a permanent magnet. The key is that even when the write head is moved away,
或区域变成永磁体 . 关键是，即使写入磁头移开，磁盘

the direction of the magnetic domains in this layer of the disk is maintained for years,
这一层中的磁畴方向也会保持多年，

and they emit a permanent magnetic field which can be repeatedly sensed by the read head every time
并且它们会发出永久磁场，每次读取时读取磁头都可以重复感应到

you read out the data stored in this sector. That is, of course, until the computer and write head
出存储在该扇区中的数据。也就是说，当然，直到计算机和写入头

rewrite a new bit of data to the domain by either flipping the direction or keeping it the same.
通过翻转方向或保持相同方向将新的数据位重写到域中。

Let’s explore how we read data from the disk. Thus far we’ve been showing domains as pointing up as a
让我们探索如何从磁盘读取数据。到目前为止，我们一直将域显示为向上指向为

binary 1 and pointing down as a 0. While this is conceptually simple, it isn’t actually the
二进制 1，向下指向为 0。虽然这在概念上很简单，但实际上并非

case. Rather the read head is designed to detect the changes in orientation from magnetic domains
如此。 相反，读头设计用于检测

pointing in one direction and then the adjacent domain pointing in the opposite direction. This
指向一个方向的磁畴方向的变化，然后是指向相反方向的相邻磁畴。 这

is because emitted magnetic fields from adjacent regions that switch their orientations are
是因为来自切换方向的相邻区域的发射磁场

much stronger than the emitted field from just a single domain pointing one direction or the other.
比来自指向一个或另一个方向的单个域的发射场强得多。

Therefore, each change in magnetic domain pointing in one direction to the opposite
因此，指向一个方向到相反

direction is assigned a 1, and an absence of a transition from one domain to the next
方向的每个磁畴变化都被指定为 1，并且从一个域到下一个域的过渡缺失

is assigned a 0. Therefore, the write head would record a binary sequence of 0011 0010 like this.
被指定为 0。因此，写入磁头将记录二进制序列 0011 0010 像这样。

Or a sequence of 1101 1110 like this, where the 1’s are changes, and the 0’s are lack of changes.
或者像这样的 1101 1110 序列，其中1 表示变化，0 表示没有变化。

So then, what’s inside the read head that detects these magnetic fields? Well, inside
那么，检测这些磁场的读头内部是什么？ 好吧，里面

is a multilayer conductive material composed of alternating layers of ferromagnetic and
是多层导电材料，由铁磁和非磁性材料的交替层组成

non-magnetic materials. This multilayer material has a property called giant magnetoresistance or
。 这种多层材料具有称为巨磁阻或

GMR, and, put simply, it’s a material that changes its resistivity depending on the
GMR 的特性，简而言之，它是一种根据

strength of magnetic fields that pass through it. Therefore, using GMR it’s a simple matter of just
穿过它的磁场强度改变其电阻率的材料。因此，使用 GMR 测量电阻率是一件简单的事情

measuring the resistivity, and when there’s a low resistivity that means there are strong magnetic
，当电阻率低时意味着磁畴方向的

fields below the read head resulting from a change in domain orientation and it’s a 1, and when
变化导致读头下方有强磁场，它为 1，当

there’s high resistivity and no change it’s a 0. However, this poses the problem of how a string
电阻率高且没有 将其更改为 0。但是，这会带来一个问题，即由

of dozens of non-changing domains can result in an ambiguous number of zeroes. To fix this,
数十个不变的域组成的字符串如何导致零的数量不明确。 为了解决这个问题，

in each sector the preamble is simply a set of alternating domains and is used
在每个扇区中，前导码只是一组交替的域，

to set the size of each domain, and then the error correcting code at the back of
用于设置每个域的大小，然后扇区后面的纠错码

the sector is used to ensure no data is lost. Next, we’re going to explore some advancements
用于确保没有数据丢失。接下来，我们将探讨

in hard disk drive technology that improve the areal density, which is the number of bits that
硬盘驱动器技术的一些进步，这些进步可以提高面密度，面密度是

can fit within a given area. In this graph, you can see how areal density has increased
给定区域内可以容纳的位数。 在此图中，您可以看到面密度

by over 50 million times throughout the past 60 years. However, perhaps more important is that
在过去 60 年中如何增加了 5000 万倍以上。 然而，也许更重要的是，

the cost to store trillions of bits of data has dropped by over 100 million times. Just imagine,
存储万亿位数据的成本下降了 1 亿多倍。 试想一下，

if we were to time travel this hard drive back to the 1960s, it would be worth over
如果我们将这块硬盘时光倒流回到 1960 年代，它的价值将超过

4 billion dollars, and now in 2022 it costs less than 40 dollars and is far faster and
40 亿美元，而现在到 2022 年，它的成本不到 40 美元，而且

more reliable than the disk drives from the 60s! Similar to the trend in hard drives, you can buy

Let’s now return to hard drives and see some of the advances that allow this disk
现在让我们回到硬盘驱动器，看看允许该磁盘

to store terabytes of data. First, around 2010 the orientation of the domain was switched from being
存储数 TB 数据的一些进步。 首先，在 2010 年左右，域的方向从水平

horizontal to vertical, and with it the write and read heads also had to change their orientation.
变为垂直，写入和读取磁头也必须随之改变方向。

This change in orientation is due to the fact that as a magnetic domain shrinks in volume,
这种方向的变化是由于随着磁畴体积的缩小，

it becomes more easily affected by temperature. So, by changing the orientation to vertical,
它变得更容易受到温度的影响。因此，通过将方向更改为垂直，

the domains or magnetic regions can utilize the depth of the material while continuing to shrink
磁畴或磁性区域可以利用材料的深度，同时继续缩小

the area on the disk that each domain takes up. The next advancement we’re going to look into
每个磁畴在磁盘上占据的区域。我们要研究的下一个进步

is called Shingled Magnetic Recording or SMR, which started being commercially available around
称为叠瓦磁记录或 SMR，它于 2020 年左右开始商用。

2020. Before shingled magnetic recording, hard drives typically used the technique,
在叠瓦磁记录之前，硬盘驱动器通常使用

Classic Magnetic Recording or CMR, where the tracks of data are 90 nanometers wide and have
经典磁记录或 CMR 技术，其中数据轨道是 90 纳米宽，

guard bands on either side of the track. However, with shingled recording,
轨道两侧都有保护带。然而，在叠瓦式录音中，写入的

the tracks are written to partially overlap with previously written tracks with no guard bands to
轨道与之前写入的轨道部分重叠，没有保护带来

separate each track. Thus, we can fit many more tracks and much more data into a given area.
分隔每条轨道。 因此，我们可以将更多的轨道和更多的数据放入给定区域。

Note that the read head is much smaller than the write head, and as a result one shingled track
请注意，读取磁头比写入磁头小得多，因此

can be reliably read at a time. The issue however is that if you write over a track,
一次可以可靠地读取一个叠瓦磁道。然而，问题是，如果您覆盖轨道，

and the upper track of shingled data is still good or valid data, the drive will first have
并且叠瓦数据的上轨道仍然是良好或有效数据，驱动器将首先必须

to read and store that valid data in the DRAM buffer, and then write both the lower track of
读取有效数据并将其存储在 DRAM缓冲区中，然后写入下轨道

new data and the upper track of valid data. And, as a result, the buffering and the extra read and
新数据和有效数据的上轨道。因此，缓冲和额外的

write steps can result in a loss of performance. The third advancement we’re going to discuss
读写步骤可能会导致性能下降。我们要讨论的第三个进步

is heat assisted magnetic recording or HAMR which is not yet commercially available. Essentially,
是热辅助磁记录或 HAMR，它尚未商业化。 本质上，

this technology utilizes a small, focused laser to heat the region that is actively being written to.
这项技术利用小型聚焦激光来加热正在积极写入的区域。

By heating the domain, the magnetic region can be more easily influenced or coerced to orient
通过加热畴，磁性区域可以更容易地受到影响或被强制定向

in a particular direction. This is necessary because both the write head and the localized
在特定方向上。 这是必要的，因为写入头和局部

electromagnetic field are incredibly small and, by making the magnetic region more easily
电磁场都非常小，并且通过使用聚焦热量使磁区域更容易

coerced using focused heat, we can continue to shrink the size of the magnetic domain.
强制，我们可以继续缩小磁畴的大小。
