#### Evergreen Notes

---

Evergreen notes are a style of knowledge management popularized by [[@Andy Matuschak|Andy Matuschak]] through his public facing notes^[[[@Andy Matuschak#^d35013]]].

The core idea is that each note should be atomic in its scope and be able to stand alone by itself. 

With Atomic notes we make them Evergreen because they get refined and stand the test of time. We can edit and add to them and improve their atomicity and specificity with active curation^[[[The curating of a zettelkasten slip box is an active practice in knowledge building and spaced repetition]]].

> "Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work."
> -- [[@Andy Matuschak|Andy Matuschak]]

With these fundamental units of knowledge we can densely link them and form our own external scaffolding of thought. 

This is not an easy process and requires active thinking and deliberation on what is important to keep and what is not. 

The note taker must also learn to not copy and paste or fall into progressive summarization but rather form your own thoughts and ideas and these are the precipitate that is kept from your consumption of media.
