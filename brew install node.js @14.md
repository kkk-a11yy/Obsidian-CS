Warning: node@14 has been deprecated because it is not supported upstream!

node@14 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have node@14 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@14/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find node@14 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/node@14/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/node@14/include"
